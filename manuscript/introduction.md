# Introduction
Most books about programming are abstract and difficult to follow because they start with explaining computing vocabulary and coding grammar. These books are very logical, as you would suspect from a text about programming, but they have a steep learning curve because it takes a long time before you achieve any results.

This book follows a different approach to teaching the R language by solving a series of mathematical problems and explaining the code needed to find the solution. This approach is inspired by the inspiring computer game books of the nineteen eighties that were filled with source code listings. Learning how to write code in this manner might be less systematic than standard textbooks, but it provides a faster learning curve because you are solving problems while you learn. For a systematic overview, the index at the end of the book lists the functionalities of the R language and the chapters that discuss them.

This book provides a solid introduction to solving mathematical problems with the R language, but it is only a way to get you started. If, after reading this book, you want to learn more about this language, there are many free and paid resources to gain further expertise. I highly recommend the data science specialisation by John Hopkins University available on Coursera or the datacamp courses.

## The R Language of Statistical Computing
R is a computing language specially designed for statistical analysis. 
- History
- Purpose and scope
- Installing the software

To start using R you need two pieces of software. Firstly, you need to install the R language itself. You can download the latest version for your operating system from the r-project.org website. The majority of Linux distributions maintain a version in their package manager. OSX ...

Secondly you will need an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to make it easier to develop code. The most popular IDE for this language is /R Studio/, which is free and open source. This software is especially designed to manage projects in R. You can use other IDEs, such as GNU Emacs with the ESS 

# Getting Started
There are two ways to use R code. The console is the running sheet of all calculations. You can write code directly into the console but it will eventually disappear below the horizon as the output scrolls ahead. When working on a project you can create a script in a file with the =.R= extension.

# Project Euler
Leonhard Euler is one of the most influential mathematicians of all time. He lived in Switserland in the Eighteenth-century and contributed to many areas of mathematics and other sciences.

Project Euler is a website with over 600 mathematical problems of various complexity.  inductive chain learning. That is, by solving one problem it will expose you to a new concept that allows you to undertake a previously inaccessible problem. So the determined participant will slowly but surely work his/her way through every problem.

Solving project Euler problems is an amusing way to teach yourself a new programming language. The remainder of this book discusses the first ten problems in Project Euler to
