# Preface
In the early nineteen eighties, my friend Leon told me that he knew a computer program. In those days, computers were mythical machines that were only used by scientists and affluent nerds. The fact that Leon knew a computer program was almost the same as having secret esoteric knowledge. He showed a two-line program on a piece of paper in the BASIC language, the most popular computing language of those days. I had no idea what it meant and it looked like a magic spell:

#+BEGIN_SRC 
10 PRINT "PETER ";
20 GOTO 10
#+END_SRC

This was a time when computers became accessible to the masses through the wave of eight-bit machines such as the Commodore 64. Soon after this experience, I purchased a ZX81, and I distinctly remember the first time I booted it. An empty screen with a blinking cursor and a message that there were 1024 bytes of memory available. The ZX81 was the start of a great adventure.

I learned to write code by copying programs from books and magazines that published listings. It was a great way to learn the grammar and logic of computing. Rather than starting from scratch, I modified the program from these books and learned by trial and error.

When studying civil engineering, I used my programming skills to solve assignments and wrote simple software to design structures. When I started my career, I stopped writing code. Lotus 123, a once popular spreadsheet package, was at that time the ideal tool. A large part of my work as a civil engineer revolved around developing ever-more complex spreadsheets.

Forward more than twenty years, and I found myself in a situation where I was no longer able to use a spreadsheet to meet my analytical needs. I decided to go back to writing code and mastered the R language. This was a transforming experience for three reasons. Firstly, writing code is the way computers are intended to be used. Instead of using the computer the way the developer thinks you want to use it, you can use it the way you see fit. Secondly, computer code is easier to reproduce and reverse-engineer than a spreadsheet. Last but not least, the R language provides access to a vast library of specialised packages to solve complex problems, including some of the most advanced machine learning algorithms.

I now promote the R language to engineers in my industry to reduce their reliance on spreadsheets. I have written this book to provide a gentle introduction into using the R language to solve mathematical problems. If you are interested in my approach to working with the R language, then perhaps you like to follow my /The Devil is in the Data/ blog on [lucidmanager.org](https://lucidmanager.org/devil-is-in-the-data/).
